Shutterstock is the leading global creativeplatform that brings together content creators

00:08.149 --> 00:11.800
and marketers.
For most companies, workforce compensation is

00:11.810 --> 00:15.800
probably one of the biggest expense items on a
company's PNL.

00:15.810 --> 00:18.540
What we were doing is just very a manual work
around.

00:18.549 --> 00:20.559
The process could lead to a lot of errors.

00:21.190 --> 00:25.120
All of our data was separated.
Our goal was to bring all that data into one

00:25.129 --> 00:28.409
central location with work day adaptive
planning.

00:28.420 --> 00:30.000
We were able to conduct hr and finance
previously that those two functions weren't

00:30.000 --> 00:33.770
We were able to conduct hr and finance
previously that those two functions weren't

00:33.779 --> 00:34.970
regularly communicating.

00:35.439 --> 00:41.610
We've now developed a workforce planning close
calendar where hr confirms that all the new job

00:41.619 --> 00:46.560
breaks are in, all the new hires are in all the
terminations or attrition has been submitted.

00:46.569 --> 00:49.599
And then we'll push that data from work day
into adaptive.

00:49.610 --> 00:53.650
And this is what our head count planning data
looks like when the market goes up or down.

00:53.659 --> 00:58.860
If we need to increase hiring, slow down hiring
adapt has been able to help us be agile and

00:58.869 --> 01:00.000
flexible with that.
And one of the benefits that we've seen is the

01:00.000 --> 01:02.009
flexible with that.
And one of the benefits that we've seen is the

01:02.020 --> 01:05.739
ease of report writing.
We've given the power to the user to be able to

01:05.750 --> 01:08.790
update and go in themselves.
Instead of having to rely on the administrative

01:08.800 --> 01:10.379
team to update reports for them.

01:12.069 --> 01:16.680
Having all of our data centralized, ended up
resulting in 10,000 hours saved annually

01:18.949 --> 01:21.250
work day.
Adapt to planning has put us in a great place

01:21.260 --> 01:25.540
to grow the business, make real time decisions
and have clean,

01:25.550 --> 01:27.610
easy real time access to data.

01:27.839 --> 01:30.000
Having all of that data within that workday
ecosystem has been beneficial to us.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.919
Having all of that data within that workday
ecosystem has been beneficial to us.

01:31.930 --> 01:35.610
You don't need to worry about data integrity
and reconciling and integrating all of that

01:35.620 --> 01:35.959
data.
