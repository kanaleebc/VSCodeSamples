00:06.300 --> 00:08.010
[Description] Marcus speaks.

4
00:08.550 --> 00:10.350
[Marcus] Edwina, what happened?

5
00:10.650 --> 00:14.070
[Edwina] Hi Marcus. My snowmobile is broken.

6
00:14.280 --> 00:16.650
[Edwina] I've been stuck here for ages.

7
00:16.740 --> 00:18.780
[Marcus] Oh no. How can I help?

8
00:19.020 --> 00:22.530
[Edwina] Could you hand me tools for my tool Bagg while I try to fix it?

9
00:22.620 --> 00:25.650
[Marcus] Of course. Just tell me which ones you need.

10
00:26.130 --> 00:29.820
[Edwina] Thanks. I'll start with the long wrench please.

11
00:29.910 --> 00:33.210
[Description] Two wrenches appear at the center of the screen. It is difficult to tell,

12
00:33.210 --> 00:34.230
[Description] which is longer. Right away.

13
00:34.680 --> 00:38.670
[Marcus] Let's see. How can I tell which wrenches longer?

14
00:38.880 --> 00:42.570
[Edwina] You need to look at the length. Lining them up will help.

15
00:42.810 --> 00:47.160
[Marcus] Okay. The wrenches start at the same place now. Great.

16
00:47.610 --> 00:50.970
[Description] The wrenches are lined up together so that they both start at the same place.

17
00:51.390 --> 00:53.850
[Description] The top wrench now appears longer than the bottom wrench.

18
00:54.210 --> 00:57.300
[Marcus] This wrench goes out farther to the side,

19
00:57.360 --> 01:00.720
[Marcus] so it's the longer one. Here you go.

20
01:00.930 --> 01:05.640
[Edwina] Thanks Marcus. This is so helpful. I'll be out of here in no time.

21
01:06.030 --> 01:07.830
[Marcus] No problem. What's next?

22
01:08.100 --> 01:10.890
[Edwina] Now I need a short screw.

[Description] The top screw goes out farther than the bottom screw,

25
01:15.630 --> 01:17.220
[Description] but it does not start at the same place.

26
01:17.400 --> 01:21.990
[Marcus] Okay. This screw does not stick out farther,

27
01:22.020 --> 01:23.970
[Marcus] so it is shorter.

28
01:23.970 --> 01:27.570
[Edwina] Are you sure? This is the shorter screw.

29
01:27.840 --> 01:32.640
[Marcus] Oops. I forgot to line them up so that they start in the same place.

30
01:33.000 --> 01:35.760
[Description] The screws are lined up so that the boat start at the same place.

31
01:36.120 --> 01:38.250
[Description] The bottom screw goes out farther than the top screw.

32
01:38.970 --> 01:43.170
[Marcus] That's better. The top screw is shorter. Here it is.

33
01:43.470 --> 01:45.420
[Edwina] Thanks so much. Next up,

34
01:45.720 --> 01:48.690
[Edwina] I need a short pair of pliers please.

35
01:49.080 --> 01:49.913
[Marcus] Let me see.

36
01:50.100 --> 01:53.460

[Description] A green pair on top and a yellow pair at the bottom.

38
01:56.850 --> 01:58.650
[Description] The green pair goes out farther than a yellow pair.

39
01:58.950 --> 02:03.330
[Marcus] This yellow pair on the bottom is definitely shorter.

40
02:03.570 --> 02:05.960
[Edwina] Just what I need. Okay,

41
02:06.540 --> 02:09.210
[Edwina] we're almost done here.

42
02:09.630 --> 02:11.850
[Edwina] Can you please pass the long bolt?

43
02:11.970 --> 02:15.750
[Description] Two bolts appear on screen. The top bolt goes at farther than the bottom bolt.

44
02:16.530 --> 02:20.880

02:21.090 --> 02:21.923

[Description] Thanks. At wiener speeds off on her snowmobile, covering Marcus and snow.

47
02:29.910 --> 02:31.120
[Edwina] Whoa. I think.

48
02:35.370 --> 02:36.560
[Marcus] Happy to help Edwina, harr.
